A quick-start example to help you to change the number of weeks in the Flutter Calendar.

You can display the required number of weeks in the Flutter Event Calendar by using the numberOfWeeksInView property of the MonthViewSettings.By default, numberOfWeeksInView starts from current week, and this can be modified using the initialDisplayDate property of calendar. In this sample the two weeks calendar is displyed by setting the numberOfWeeksInView property with the value 2.
